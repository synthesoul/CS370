# 📜 CS 370 Portfolio – Christian Busca

This repository contains my work for CS 370, covering multiple projects and assignments that showcase my growth in artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and neural network development.

## 📂 Projects and Assignments

### 📄 Assignment 1 – Introduction to AI Concepts
**File:** `Busca_Christian_Assignment1.ipynb`

In this assignment, I explored foundational concepts in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I analyzed early AI approaches and discussed how different intelligent systems operate. This work helped build the theoretical background needed for later projects.

---

### 📄 Assignment 3 – Machine Learning Project
**File:** `Busca_Christian_Assignment3_finalized.ipynb`

In this project, I applied supervised machine learning techniques to solve real-world data problems. I worked on data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using standard classification models. This assignment provided valuable experience with practical machine learning pipelines.

### 🎯 Module 5 Project – Cartpole Reinforcement Learning
**File:** `Cartpole-Busca.ipynb`

In this project, I built and trained a reinforcement learning agent to solve the Cartpole balancing problem. I implemented a deep Q-learning model that learned how to balance a pole through trial-and-error reward optimization. This project helped develop my skills in reinforcement learning and model convergence analysis.

### ⚓ Project Two Milestone – Pirate Agent Initial Setup
**File:** `ProjectTwoMilestone_AgentNotebook.ipynb`

This milestone marked the early planning and setup of the pirate intelligent agent project. I designed the initial deep Q-learning architecture, defined training strategies, and prepared the foundation for the final implementation.

### 🏴‍☠️ Project Two Final – Pirate Intelligent Agent
**File:** `TreasureHuntGame_Busca.ipynb`

For the final project, I implemented a deep Q-learning pirate agent capable of autonomously navigating a maze to find a treasure. I built the neural network, implemented the full training loop, managed exploration vs. exploitation, and validated the agent's performance through a completion check. The agent achieved a 100% win rate within 10 epochs, demonstrating strong learning and generalization.

## ✍️ Module Eight Journal Reflection

### What work did I do myself?

Throughout the course, I created all model-building, training, and evaluation code myself. Starter files provided environments or replay memory classes (for Cartpole and Pirate projects), but all reinforcement learning logic, deep learning model design, and training optimization were implemented independently.

### How does this connect to computer science?

Computer scientists design intelligent systems that solve complex real-world problems. Reinforcement learning is a vital area in AI that enables systems to learn behaviors through interaction, a major theme across my projects.

### How do I approach problems as a computer scientist?

I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller components, designing modular, testable solutions, and iterating through development cycles. This systematic approach was critical in the design and training of my agents.

### What are my ethical responsibilities?

It is essential to ensure AI systems are fair, transparent, and safe. My agents were carefully designed to align rewards with intended outcomes and avoid unintended or biased behaviors during learning.
