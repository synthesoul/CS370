## Pirate Intelligent Agent Submission

For this project, I submitted my completed Jupyter Notebook (`TreasureHuntGame_Busca.ipynb`) where I created a pirate intelligent agent capable of autonomously finding treasure in a maze environment. This project highlights how I applied reinforcement learning and deep Q-learning techniques to train an agent to solve a real-world problem.

## Reflection

### 1. Briefly explain the work that you did on this project
**What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**

For the pirate intelligent agent project, I was provided with two starter Python files: `TreasureMaze.py`, which defined the maze environment, and `GameExperience.py`, which managed experience replay. Using these, I wrote all of the Jupyter Notebook code myself â€” including the deep Q-learning model, the training loop, the epsilon-greedy exploration strategy, the reward structure, and the completion check. The agent reached a 100% win rate in fewer than 10 epochs.

In earlier assignments, such as `Busca_Christian_Assignment1.ipynb` and `Busca_Christian_Assignment3_finalized.ipynb`, I explored supervised learning and foundational AI concepts. In the `Cartpole-Busca.ipynb` project, I trained a reinforcement learning agent to balance a pole, which helped prepare me for Project Two.

### 2. Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**  
Computer scientists design intelligent systems, algorithms, and models that solve complex real-world problems. Their work impacts industries like healthcare, gaming, finance, and manufacturing. In this course, I learned how AI agents, through reinforcement learning, can autonomously learn to make decisions, which is a key part of modern computer science innovation.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  
I approach problems systematically: breaking down the problem into components, designing modular solutions, testing incrementally, and iterating based on results. For example, I developed the pirate agent's neural network separately from the training loop, ensuring each component worked before integrating them.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**  
Computer scientists must ensure systems are fair, transparent, and safe. In reinforcement learning projects, it is important to monitor agents' learning to prevent unintended behaviors. I designed my pirate agent with ethical considerations in mind by aligning its reward structure carefully with intended outcomes.
